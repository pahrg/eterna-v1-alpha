# Demonstration standalone deployment

ETERNA standalone deployment with a single-node Solr and Zookeeper services. It also includes additional support services for file format identification (Siegfried) and virus check (ClamAV). ETERNA is configured with a default index configuration of four (4) shards and one (1) replica per shard. This deployment is set to be run on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), to change some alterations to the configuration will be required.

This is an example deployment and SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR PRODUCTION, due to security, performance and stability reasons. Please check [WhiteRed ETERNA](https://www.whitered.se/eterna) for advice on how to go into production.

Requirements:
- Linux or macOS (Windows is not supported)
- Docker: [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose: [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

```sh
# Download the docker compose
wget https://github.com/ETERNA-earkiv/ETERNA/raw/main/deploys/standalone/docker-compose.yaml

# Start services:
docker compose up -d
## This may take a couple of minutes to initialize, specially the first startup
## If it takes too long, check the logs

# Check the logs (CTRL+C to escape)
docker compose logs -f --tail=100
```

When the services load, they should be available on the Web browser:
* ETERNA will be at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (user: admin, password: eterna)
* REST-API documentation will be at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) (same passwords as in ETERNA)
* Indexing backend (Solr) will be at [http://localhost:8983](http://localhost:8983) (not protected, must be protected in production)

Note: If you are upgrading an existing installation, the change to the default admin password only applies to fresh deployments where the LDAP directory is initialized from scratch. Existing installations keep their current credentials; change them manually if needed via the UI or LDAP tools.

When finished, stop the services:
```sh
# Stop services:
docker compose down
```
